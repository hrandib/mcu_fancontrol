# The template configuration file for the mcu_fancontrol project, must not be used directly

# --- Sensor binding ---
# Sensor types:
# 1. DS18B20
# 2. LM75
#   Both types of sensors are match by the 'id' property.
#   The hardware supports up 4 sensors of each type, 8 sensors in total.
#   LM75 ID directly corresponds to I2C address of the particular IC (0x00-0x07 range)
#   DS18B20 ID is based on the sensor ROM CRC (but not equal to it) and
#     it can be matched with the real sensor via utility: fanutil.py -p [COM PORT] -s
sensors:

# --- PWM channel binding ---
# 1. channel
#   Channel binding, the controller supports two pwm channels: 0 and 1
# 2. minpwm
#   Minimum PWM value in % for the selected channel
#   Default: 0
# 3. maxpwm
#   Maximum PWM value in % for the selected channel
#   Default: 100
# 4. fanstop_hyst
#   Fan start/stop hysteresis value in degrees Celsius,
#   e.g. if controller defines lowest temperature setting as 50 and hysteresis equals to 5,
#   the fan will be stopped after reaching 45 degrees and then will be started at 50 degrees.
#   Set to 0 to disable fan stop function (default value)
pwms:

# --- Controller binding ---
#   Links sensor declarations to pwm declarations with defined control algorithm
#   Can link multiple sensors to the single pwm.
#   sensor: Sensor binding entry. Can be multiple (up to 4), highest temperature will be used as a reference
#   pwm: PWM channel binding entry
# 1. mode
#   Control algorithm, possible values:
#   two_point - simple 2 point curve transformation
#   pi - proportional-integral control algorithm
#
# 2. poll_time
#   Sampling time in seconds
# 3. set
#   Special options for selected control algorithm (mode)
#
#   For 'two_point' it contains min and max allowed temperature: 'tmin', 'tmax'
#   - min temperature maps to the 'minpwm' sensor value
#   - max temperature maps to the 'maxpwm' sensorvalue
#
#   For 'pi' it contains:
#   t - desired temperature setting
#   kp - proportional coefficient, maximum allowed value = 20, higher values will be truncated to this limit
#   ki - integral coefficient, maximum allowed value = 2.5, higher values will be truncated to this limit
#   max_i - maximum allowed value for I component in percents, default value = 50
#
# 4. k_ema
#   Î± coefficient of EMA filter, default value = 1 (Disabled)
